# PART 6 - Add Mailgun

Next up we‚Äôll integrate email into our application‚Ä¶

There are many email providers we could use but for demonstration purpose we will go with Mailgun‚Ä¶

- https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup
- And after signing up you‚Äôll have to verify your account via an Authorization Code that you‚Äôll receive in either your inbox or on your phone‚Ä¶
- After you complete this account verification process, you can then provision an API key
    - This API key is what will authenticate our application with Mailgun‚Äôs Email API
- We can store this API key in the .env file by adding an entry that reads MAILGUN_API_KEY=<API_KEY_HERE>
- And now let‚Äôs add some code for testing that we can indeed send emails from our application
- If we come over to the domains page of the Mailgun console (https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/domains), we can see that Mailgun provides us with a free domain for testing‚Ä¶
- We will be able to send emails FROM this domain TO any email we list as an authorized recipient here‚Ä¶
- To authorize a recipient, we enter and submit an email address using this form AND will need the owner of the address to accept an invitation they‚Äôll receive in their INBOX
- After we authorize some email we own (by own I mean we have access to its inbox), let‚Äôs add the following code to our application‚Ä¶
    - touch helpers/send_email.py
```
import requests
import os

def send_email():
    print("Sending email...")
    requests.post(
      "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/sandboxd7c358e02f26415dbb7329dd994a8334.mailgun.org/messages",
      auth=("api", os.getenv("MAILGUN_API_KEY")),
      data={"from": "Wishbliss Mailing List <mailgun@sandboxd7c358e02f26415dbb7329dd994a8334.mailgun.org>",
        "to": ["tad@cmdlabs.io"],
        "subject": "Hello",
        "text": "Testing !!! some !!! weirdness"})
```

    - main.py
```
send_email()
```

- After adding this code, we can test our script again and we should receive an email in our SPAM folder
- Out of courtesy of time tho let‚Äôs comment out most of our code and just test that emailing with Mailgun works‚Ä¶
- python main.py
- If you don‚Äôt mind finishing this walkthrough with emails being delivered to SPAM then skip ahead to PART 7
- BUT if you‚Äôd like the emails to be delivered to people‚Äôs INBOX as expected, here are the steps you‚Äôll need to take‚Ä¶
    - Come over to the https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/domains page again and click ‚ÄúAdd new domain‚Äù
    - Then specify the subdomain of some domain you own for example I used the name mail.wishbliss.link (where my domain is wishbliss.link)
    - After you add your domain you‚Äôll be presented with a list of records that you‚Äôll need to add to your domain‚Äôs DNS settings through your DNS provider
    - Here is what adding these Mailgun records to my DNS settings in AWS Route 53 looks like for reference
    - And after these records are added to our DNS we can click `Verify` to have Mailgun confirm that we‚Äôre indeed the owner of this domain
    - And now, when we send emails from our verified domain with Mailgun, the emails should land in our INBOX as expected
        - ie: noreply@wishbliss.link

If you have issues purchasing a domain or verifying it with your email provider, leave a comment or paste detailed descriptions of your issues into either Google or ChatGPT. If you‚Äôve gotten this far, don‚Äôt be discouraged. Setting up emailing for a custom domain is not too difficult but can be a little bit tricky depending on the details of your setup. If someone in the audience knows of a simpler way to implement email integrations please leave a comment and I‚Äôll pin it to the top of the comments.

Let‚Äôs move on to PART 7
